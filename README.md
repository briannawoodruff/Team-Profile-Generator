  ## Description:
  The motivation behind this project was to create an application that generates an HTML webpage that displays information about members in a team. <br /><br />  This is a command-line application where the user is prompted by the Inquirer npm package. The user inputs information about each team member and is asked questions based on their role to generate the HTML page. It is initiated by running NodeJS and was tested with the Jest npm package. <br /><br />  For future development of this project, I would like to add a GitHub API call to confirm that the username inputted is a profile.
